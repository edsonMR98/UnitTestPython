# UnittestPython

This repo was developed to test packages for unit tests in Python. Two packages were selected.

## unittest
The [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#module-unittest) unit testing framework was originally inspired by JUnit and has a similar flavor as major unit testing frameworks in other languages. It supports test automation, sharing of setup and shutdown code for tests, aggregation of tests into collections, and independence of the tests from the reporting framework.

## doctest
The [doctest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html#module-doctest) module searches for pieces of text that look like interactive Python sessions, and then executes those sessions to verify that they work exactly as shown.
